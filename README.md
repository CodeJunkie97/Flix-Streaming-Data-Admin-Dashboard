# Full App Description
This is another Full Stack Application that I have been working on in my free time which is basically a admin dashboard that you can connect to another full stack application for which you would like to get User or Product data from. I wanted to create this for my Flix-Movie-Streaming-App but I also wanted to make it an independent thing that can be customized and used for data visualization of other applications. It includes dashboards, lists, useful windows like stats and notifications. There is an app service section that contains things like App Health, Logs, and App Settings. Finally there is a user profile section, with a light and dark mode toggle. The user can switch between light and dark mode based on there preferences. This app is still a work in progress. Learn more below!

# Current Status
At this point, I have many features of the UI Dashboard completed. I am currently in the process of connecting this admin dashboard to my Flix-Movie-Streaming-Application. I am still in the very early stages of this process but you can still see what the UI looks like with Dummy Data involved. There are instructions on how to run the current version of the app on localhost below.

## Runbook Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine. 
2. Run 'npm install' to install all of the required libraries and then run 'npm start' to launch the development server
3. The Server will be hosted on port 3000.
